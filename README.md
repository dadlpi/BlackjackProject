# BlackjackProject
The purpose of this project is meant to be an exercise practicing Object Oriented Programming skills where the program written is a BlackJack Application (Go Fish or a 21 game) application. The entire functionality of the program is meant to simulate a one player game against a BlackJack dealer, all relevant playing objects have been written into Java code form providing similar behaviors that are expected from the minimum BlackJack real world objects and game logic have been written into code: Card Suits, Card Numbers, Deck of Cards, Player, Dealer, Hands and BlackJack game logic.

# Description
At run time you can expect that the BlackJackApp will respond the same way as playing a physical in person game of BlackJack. Two cards are dealt with the Dealer's being hidden until the Player decides to stop hitting (incrementing) the number of cards they are adding to their hand. Then the existing dealer's hand becomes visible and the dealer will continue to increment to their hand so long as they do not reach or exceed the a count of 17. Once the dealer reaches their maximum hit marker, the count of 17, they too stop incrementing and stand forcing an evaluation between dealer and player. This reveals the winner. 

The foregoing is true, so long as in the incrementing/hitting process neither player or dealer exceed the count of 21. The player/dealer exceeding 21 results as the loser forfeiting the win to the other party.

Finally mentioning that a directly dealt card or a card incremented/hit that results in a count of 21 is a direct win. Known as BlackJack.

# Tech Used

# Lessons Learned
This project, homework assignment covered information that was covered in the lectures giving me hands on practice, further reinforcing what I had learned. However, the biggest lesson learned here was that this project felt insurmountable at first and panic set in quickly. So the lesson learned in through this last week's lecture and climaxing with his homework assignment was what I would label as RULE #1 - Do not panic. The moment I begin to panic I loose control of my mind and am unable to focus on anything - everything begins to looks like alphabet soup. So being able to calm myself and working on small sections of code logic at a time eventually allowed me to finish the project. And although I will say this was a complex project that would take me quite possible the same amount to complete if I had to do it over again, I need to keep reminding myself for future Java work about RULE #1 - do not panic. Else nothing will get done in panic mode.
